## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up the Student Council Voice Manager bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aitji/tools
    cd tools/move-stage
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    This bot uses `discord.js` and `dotenv` for Discord API interaction and environment management:
    ```bash
    npm install discord.js dotenv
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your bot's Discord token:
    ```ini
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
    ```

4. **Configure the bot**:
    Update the `CONFIG` object in the code with your server's specific IDs (see [Configuration](#configuration-) section).

5. **Run the bot**:
    Start the bot by running:
    ```bash
    node bot.js
    ```

## Configuration üîß

Before running the bot, you need to configure the following settings in the `CONFIG` object:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    SERVER_ID: 'your-server-id',
    ALLOWED_ROLES: [
        'role-id-1',
        'role-id-2',
        'role-id-3',
        'role-id-4'
    ],
    VOICE_CHANNELS: {
        'channel-id-1': 'Ôæâüü¢‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà 1  (‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏•‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏°‡πå)',
        'channel-id-2': 'Ôæâüîµ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà 2  (‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏©‡∏Å‡∏£)',
        'channel-id-3': 'Ôæâüî¥‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà 3  (‡∏à‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏ô‡∏µ)',
        'channel-id-4': 'Ôæâüü°‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà 4  (‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥)'
    },
    STAGE_CHANNEL_ID: 'stage-channel-id'
}
```

## Usage üöÄ

Once the bot is running and properly configured, student council members with appropriate roles can use the `/move` command with different actions.

### `/move on-stage` Command

- **Purpose**: Move all members from group voice channels to the stage channel for meetings
- **Process**: 
  1. Scans all configured voice channels
  2. Saves each member's original location
  3. Moves everyone to the stage channel
  4. Suppresses members in stage channel
  5. Hides original voice channels
  6. Sends DM notifications to moved members

### `/move back` Command

- **Purpose**: Return all members to their original voice channels after the meeting
- **Process**:
  1. Loads saved location data
  2. Moves members back to their original channels
  3. Unhides all voice channels
  4. Sends confirmation DMs
  5. Clears saved location data

### `/move list` Command

- **Purpose**: View currently saved member locations
- **Shows**: Username, original channel name, and total count

## How It Works ‚ö°

1. **Permission Validation**: 
    Only users with specified student council roles or server administrators can execute commands.

2. **Voice Channel Scanning**: 
    The bot scans all configured group voice channels to identify members that need to be moved.

3. **Location Persistence**: 
    Member locations are saved to a JSON file (`location.json`) to ensure data persists between bot restarts.

4. **Progressive Operations**: 
    Large operations are processed with progress tracking and rate limiting to prevent Discord API rate limits.

5. **DM Queue System**: 
    Direct messages are sent through a queue system with concurrent limits to avoid spam restrictions.

6. **Channel Management**: 
    Voice channels are temporarily hidden during stage events to prevent confusion and unauthorized access.
